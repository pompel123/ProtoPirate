# **ProtoPirate**

### _for Flipper Zero_
just take it down with stupid dmca notice. no one used ur code mate


ProtoPirate is an experimental rolling-code analysis toolkit developed by members of **The Pirates' Plunder**.
The app currently supports decoding for multiple automotive key-fob families (Kia, Ford, Subaru, Suzuki, VW, and more), with the goal of being a drop-in Flipper app (.fap) that is free, open source, and can be used on any Flipper Zero firmware.

## **Supported Protocols**

Decoders:

- KIA V0
- KIA V1
- KIA V2
- KIA V3 / V4
- KIA V5
- Ford V0
- Subaru
- Suzuki
- Volkswagen (VW)

Encoders: **Coming Soon**
- KIA V0

## **Development Reference**

The `reference/` directory contains code and data that may be useful for future development of encoders.

**IMPORTANT:** The C code in this directory is **not functional** and should not be integrated into the application without significant modification. It contains a flawed Keeloq implementation that is missing the necessary key derivation step. The manufacturer keys and protocol structures may still be useful as a starting point for a correct implementation.
